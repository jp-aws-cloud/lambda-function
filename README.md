# What is AWS Lambda?

You can use AWS Lambda to run code without provisioning or managing `servers`.

Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and `automatic scaling`, and `logging`. 

With Lambda, all you need to do is supply your code in one of the language runtimes that Lambda supports.
